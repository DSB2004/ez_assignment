# Deployment

For production deployment, the project will be containerized using docker and hosted on a cloud server (such as AWS EC2). The following technologies and setup will be used to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability:

- Gunicorn will serve the Django application as the WSGI HTTP server.\

- Celery will handle background tasks such as file uploads and processing.

- Redis will be used as the message broker for Celery to efficiently queue and manage tasks.

- ImageKit.io will be used for cloud-based file storage and CDN delivery, ensuring fast and scalable file handling.

- Environment variables will manage secrets and configuration using .env.

- PostgreSQL will be used with data storage along with proper backups and security.
- Docker Compose will be used to orchestrate multiple services (Django, Redis, PostgreSQL, Celery workers) during deployment.

- Logging and Monitoring will be enabled using standard Django logging or tools like Sentry for error tracking and alerting
